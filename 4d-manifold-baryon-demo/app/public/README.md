# Public Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets that will be served directly by Next.js.

## What goes here:
- Images (logos, icons, etc.)
- favicon.ico
- robots.txt
- sitemap.xml
- Any other static files that need to be publicly accessible

Files in this directory can be referenced from the root of your domain. For example, if you put an image called `logo.png` in this directory, you can reference it in your code as `/logo.png`.
